📊 **COVID-19 Data Analysis using Python**

This project focuses on analyzing COVID-19 case data across Indian states using Python.  
It demonstrates how raw data can be cleaned, transformed, and visualized to extract meaningful insights.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to:
- Clean COVID-19 data using Pandas
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends across Indian states and years
- Understand real-world data handling for beginners (freshers)

---

## 🚀 Advanced Features Added
- ✔ Proper data cleaning (handling missing values without dropping data)
- ✔ Date conversion using `datetime`
- ✔ Feature engineering (Year and Month extraction)
- ✔ State-wise and year-wise aggregation using `groupby`
- ✔ Multiple visualizations (Bar chart, Line chart, Pie chart)
- ✔ Insight-based analysis instead of direct plotting

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation  
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps
- Checked dataset structure using `info()` and `describe()`
- Handled missing values using:
  - Mean / forward fill methods
- Converted date column into datetime format
-Performed date-based analysis using the date column
- Ensured consistency in state names

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The following analyses were performed:
- State-wise total confirmed cases
- Top 10 states by confirmed cases
- Year-wise COVID-19 trend analysis
- Monthly comparison using line plots
- Percentage contribution using pie charts

---

## 📈 Visualizations
- 📊 Bar chart – State-wise confirmed cases  
- 📈 Line chart – Year-wise COVID-19 trend  
- 🥧 Pie chart – State-wise case distribution  

(All plots include proper titles, labels, and legends.)

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Maharashtra recorded the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases.
- COVID-19 cases showed a sharp increase during peak years.
- A small number of states contributed a major share of total cases.
- Data cleaning significantly improved the accuracy of analysis.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow using Python — from raw data cleaning to visualization and insights.  
It is ideal for **freshers** learning data analysis and Python-based visualization.
